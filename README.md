## **What is React?**

React is a JavaScript library for building fast, scalable front-end applications. It is known for its component-based structure, single-page applications (SPAs), and virtual DOM, enabling efficient UI updates and a seamless user experience. <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/what-are-the-advantages-of-react-js/>

### **Advantages of React**

- __Component-Based Architecture:__ React encourages breaking down the UI into reusable components, which can be used throughout the application, saving development time and effort (_Reusability_). Changes in one component generally don't affect other components, making it easier to maintain and update the application (_Maintainability_).
- __Virtual DOM:__ React uses a Virtual DOM (_lightweight representation of the actual DOM_) to improve the performance of web applications. Instead of updating the real DOM directly, React first updates the Virtual DOM and compares it to the previous one, applying only the minimal changes required (_Improved Performance and Optimized Rendering_).
- __SEO-Friendly:__ React offers features that help make applications SEO-friendly, including _Server-Side Rendering (SSR)_ and _Static Site Generation (SSG)_. These methods allow React to generate content that search engines can easily crawl and index.
- __Fast Rendering:__ React ensures fast rendering by utilizing the _Virtual DOM and the Reconciliation Algorithm_. These mechanisms minimize unnecessary re-renders, improving the responsiveness of the application. React batches multiple state updates together in one go to reduce the number of re-renders.
- __Cross-Platform Mobile Development with React Native:__ React Native allows developers to use React to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase. This leads to faster development and code reuse across platforms.

### **Reconciliation Algorithm**

The Reconciliation Algorithm is responsible for comparing the previous Virtual DOM with the new one to determine what changed. React uses an optimized diffing algorithm to minimize the number of changes it needs to apply to the real DOM.

### **React Fiber**
React Fiber is the reimplementation of the React core algorithm that improves the rendering performance, especially in complex applications.

React.memo() for Functional Components: React provides a higher-order component called React.memo() that can be used to optimize the rendering of functional components.
